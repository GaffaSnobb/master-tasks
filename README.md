# USAGE
### Each directory in this repository (eg. Sc44, V50) contains a Python script which has all necessary plotting commands to reproduce the figures in my masters thesis. However, since the data files from KSHELL are quite large I have compressed the files so that they can fit in this repository. So please be sure to uncompress any `.tgz` file with `tar -xzvf filename.tgz` before running the corresponding Python script. The uncompressed `.txt` files should be placed in the same directory as the `.tgz` file they came from. When this is done all you should have to do is run the Python script. If something is malfunctioning please create an issue in this repo so I can fix the problem.

# ATTENTION:
### Per 2022-10-09 some trouble with LFS has resulted in some files in this repo to be rolled back to very old versions. Most of the code in this repo will therefore not work. I am currently restoring from backups to resolve the issue.
